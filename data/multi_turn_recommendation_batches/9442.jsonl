Do you prefer something set in a specific era or with a particular style, like black and white or noir themes?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I love those old detective stories from the 1940s, especially if they have a clever parody twist."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You should definitely check out *Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid*! It's a hilarious neo-noir comedy that brilliantly parodies 1940s detective films, starring the great Steve Martin. It's quirky, witty, and packed with mystery and nostalgia 🎬😂❤️!"}]}
